# SchemaBot: Automated Database Design with NLP
SchemaBot is an innovative web application designed to automate database design by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP). The app allows users to input prompts or database scenarios, and it outputs the corresponding entities, attributes, relationships, Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), and SQL table queries for the database.
This project integrates Python, JavaScript, and several libraries to handle text manipulation and generate an efficient database schema based on user input.
## Features
- **NLP Integration**: Converts user-provided database scenarios into structured database schema components such as entities, attributes, and relationships.
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Automatically generates an ERD based on the scenario.
- **SQL Query Generation**: Outputs the SQL table creation queries based on the generated schema.
- **User-friendly Interface**: A simple web interface to interact with the bot and view generated outputs.
## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python (for NLP processing)
- **Frontend**: JavaScript (for web interaction)
- **Libraries**: Various Python and JavaScript libraries for text manipulation, NLP, and query generation.

## Usage
1. Enter a database scenario or prompt into the provided text box.
2. Click "Generate Schema" to see the entities, attributes, relationships, ERD, and SQL queries.
3. The application will output the corresponding schema and SQL queries based on the scenario.
